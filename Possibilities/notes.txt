Finding patterns across a set of knots. One approach is to take a set
of knots and learn a common operator sequence. An alternative is to
take a set of learned sequences from different knots and then do some
kind of post hoc pattern analysis (like Uri Alon's "motif analysis").

What should we compare our algorithm with? Random search? A greedy
mutation algorithm?
